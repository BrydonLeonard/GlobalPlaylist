# Global Playlist

To run locally:

```
python generate_playlists.py
```


## TODO
Some missing features:
- Limits per language to reduce the number of songs we get in the more common languages
- Packaging to make lambda deployments easy
- Functionality to invalidate playlist cache
- Easier creds setup somehow?
